## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.x or later
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## 🌐 Deploy to GitHub Pages

Since this is a Next.js app, you need to export it as static HTML for GitHub Pages:

### Step 1 — Configure static export

Add `output: 'export'` to `next.config.ts`:

```ts
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  basePath: '/globalpathwaysbd',  // match your repo name
  images: { unoptimized: true },
};
export default nextConfig;
```

### Step 2 — Build and deploy

```bash
npm run build
```

The static site will be generated in the `out/` folder.

### Step 3 — Enable GitHub Pages

1. Push the `out/` folder to a `gh-pages` branch, or use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages)
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source** and select the branch
3. Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/globalpathwaysbd/`

> **Tip:** You can also use the [`gh-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) npm package for automated deployment.
